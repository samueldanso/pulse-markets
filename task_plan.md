# Task Plan: Demo-Ready Missing Features

## Goal
Implement all missing UI features from pending.md so judges can complete the full demo flow.

## Features / Steps
- [x] Feature 1: ERC-8004 agent profile block on market detail after settlement
- [x] Feature 2: Deposit flow — minimal deposit modal/explainer for demo
- [x] Feature 3: Withdraw flow — withdraw button/modal for demo
- [x] Feature 4: Channel status + user balance display in app navbar
- [x] Feature 5: Dashboard page — user positions view
- [x] Feature 6: Landing CTA — "Start Trading" button links to /markets
- [x] Feature 7: Update testing.md with full demo instructions

## Current
**Working on**: Complete
**Status**: all steps done

## Decisions
- Deposit/withdraw: Demo-friendly modals explaining the Yellow flow, not full custody integration (operator pre-funded)
- Dashboard: Simple positions list from user store
- Agent profile: Inline block on market detail page after settlement
- Dark theme for (app) layout not in scope — keep consistent light theme
